<h1>The Best Movies According to Joey</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Is it cheating to include a trilogy as one entry? I don't think so! These characters mean so much to me, this series changed literature and fantasy, and the story reminds me to never lose hope.</p>
<h3>Kubo and the Two Strings</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful and delightful stop-motion animated movie that I return to time and again when I need some magic and joy.</p>
<h3>Men in Black</h3>
<p>I grew up watching this movie over and over. It is fun, it has aliens, and it has been a staple in my life since I was a child.</p>
